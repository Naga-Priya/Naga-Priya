What is a webserver?
When u submit the form, it goes to webserver. Webserver has business logic. sometimes the processing might need data from data base, so server will communicate with DB layer and fetch the data needed and return the result to browser.

Webserver tech Java,.net,php
Data layer: SQL cerver, Oracle, mySql

HTML Elements:
1. Input: any input like testbox, dropdown e.t.c
label for=<id> to uniquely specify a label for the textbox.

Attributes:
-----------
readonly 
required

Name attribute is used to group radio buttons together.
Since Id is unique for element, we use id to attach label to elements.
attributes: type, id, name, value, checked

<fieldset> and <legend>
Fieldset is a bordered area, Legend is a caption for the field set.

??
button onclick()

In datalist, user can use the values as suggestions and can choose to enter a value of his own.

date picker: input type = date
email: input type = email
type = range

Assignment1:
Monthly expense report: 
Create a form to put values for  fields (Mortgage <text>, gas<text>,childcare <text>, Insurance <text>, utility <text>, Misc <text>)
Upon Save, go to Details.html page, show all the inputs in tabular form. (We need to know Java script to fetch the values from first form)
Options: customize the form to try out as many elements as possible. E.g, some expense is for monthly, sopme are for annually. try using radio buttons and check boxes to choose options.
try using column span, row span

Day 4:
<iframes>
<meta> tag is information for browser, it is used for SEA, search engine optimization
it has attributes like:
name and content which used to provide some keywords to search engine to identify our web page
<meta charset ="utf-8">
<meta name="author" content="Harry Potter">

<emojis>
Emoji's are characters in utf-8, they look like code numbers, when included in HTML, it displays emoji's at run time. the code is in decimal<prefix &#> or hex decimal<prefix &#x>

Fevicon<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="path of .ico file">
This is displayed next to title

type can be icon, or png e.t.c but icon is the standard.

*BROWSER specific*
Favicon of size 16X16 will not be displayed on Chrome.
So always choose icon of size 48X48 or above

Entities:
--------
when special character is needed use entities 
e.g: '&dollar' to display $  sign
since '<' is reserved for HTML tags, using it in text might not display in different browsers, so use &lt instead.

<Form action="Which page to go" method="post">
by default when a form is submitted the method is GET, this displays all the data in form elements. To avoid exposing the data choose methods. POST will not show the data.

Emojis

When u submit the form, it goes to webserver. Webserver has business logic. sometimes the processing might need data from data base, so server will communicate with DB layer and fetch the data needed and return the result to browser.

HTML Elements:
1. Input: any input like testbox, dropdown e.t.c
label for=<id> to uniquely specify a label for the textbox.

Name attribute is used to group radio buttons together.
Since Id is unique for element, we use id to attach label to elements.
attributes: type, id, name, value, checked

<fieldset> and <legend>
Fieldset is a bordered area, Legend is a caption for the field set.

In datalist, user can use the values as suggestions and can choose to enter a value of his own.
